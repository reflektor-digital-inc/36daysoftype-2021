  body1 : `Get a piece of the action! Finally, each of our fully interactive 36 Days of Type letters are available on the Polygon blockchain for you to own. Building on Polygon ensures that our NFTs are as energy efficient as possible, while also minimizing costly gas fees.
  <br><br>
  All 36 NFTs will be pre-minted and are priced on a sliding scale between 1-5 Matic according to their creativity and complexity. <b>Purchasing will go live at 12pm ET on February 2nd</b>. We’ll be supporting both WalletConnect and MetaMask as wallet providers.`,

  body2 : `The marketplace you’re seeing right now was built in-house by Reflektor Digital. All of our polygon API requests on the frontend are handled through your wallet, our smart contract is developed in Solidity, completely tested and minted using Hardhat, and all metadata stored using the decentralized file sharing protocol IPFS.
  <br><br>
  Each NFT includes high-resolution looping renders from the project itself and will also display as an interactive iframe on NFT viewing platforms such OpenSea.
